                <p>Many training programs offer a lot of content, but not enough practice. With Practera Employ, skills are developed through <strong>hands-on projects</strong> that mimic real-world situations. There is a strong focus on teamwork, communication and leadership skills, which are highly desired by employers. Learners get constructive <strong>feedback from real experts</strong> who evaluate the work as if they were managing the learner.</p>
